/*******************************************************************************
* Function Name: process_spi_led_data
********************************************************************************
* Summary:
* This function creates the required data packets for the serial LEDs. 
* Each LED has 3 color and each color can have brightness fromm 0 to 255 (1 byte)
* Each bit of LED color is represented by 4 bits in the SPI transmission frame - 
* '0' => '1000' and '1' => '1110'.
*
* This functions performs following:
*  - initializes and fills the SPI packet ledTxBuffer as per user LED data,
*  - initiates transfer of ledTxBuffer through SPI master,
*  - clears the SPI Tx FIFO after the completion of data transfer
*
* Parameters:
* The pointer to the serial LED context structure ledDataContext_t.
